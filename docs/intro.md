# Introduction – Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## 1. Purpose of This Textbook

This textbook introduces the foundations of Physical AI and humanoid robotics through a structured and practice-aligned approach. The aim is to connect intelligent algorithms with real-world embodiment, enabling learners to understand how autonomous systems sense, decide, and act within physical environments. Students and educators will gain a clear pathway from theoretical principles to practical implementation.

## 2. The Role of Physical AI

Physical AI focuses on computational models that operate inside the real world rather than simulated spaces. These models interact with gravity, friction, inertia, and unpredictable conditions. The field merges robotics, control theory, AI reasoning, and biomechanics. In humanoid robotics, Physical AI enables natural motion, balanced locomotion, purposeful manipulation, and adaptive decision-making.

## 3. Evolution of Humanoid Robotics

Modern humanoids extend far beyond rigid industrial machines. They integrate high-precision mechanics, advanced sensors, multimodal perception, and distributed control software. ROS 2, learning-based models, and whole-body frameworks support complex behaviors that resemble coordinated human movement. This evolution provides robotics students with a comprehensive platform for experimentation and innovation.

## 4. Structure of the Learning Path

The textbook is divided into three focused modules.

Module 01: introduces ROS 2 as the communication backbone, covering nodes, topics, services, Python integration, and URDF.

Module 02: explains physical intelligence, motion planning, stability models, and sensor fusion for dynamic control.

Module 03: explores humanoid manipulation, dynamic force control, grasping, visual perception, and safety strategies.

This structure guides learners from middleware essentials to advanced whole-body interaction.

## 5. Intended Audience

This material is suitable for robotics students, engineers, educators, and researchers seeking a solid foundation in humanoid systems. It balances conceptual clarity with practical insight, allowing both beginners and experienced developers to broaden their understanding of embodied AI.
